A live histogram plugin for vlc.

This software should be stable enough for general public usage.
Although I still consider this as beta quality, mostly because
some lack of features (see TODO).

Usage:
$ vlc --video-filter histogram <your_video_file>

The following keys are functional:

[Delete]   : Hide histogram
[Home]     : Show histogram (default on)
[Page Up]  : Set logarithmic scale
[Page Down]: Set linear scale (default on)
[Enter]    : Toggle RGB/Luminance mode (default RGB)
/          : Toggle R,G,B equalization on/off (default off)
